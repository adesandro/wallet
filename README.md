- Uses industry-standard cryptography: ed25519, BIP39/BIP32, BLAKE3
- No analytics, no tracking, no external data collection
- Open source — audit the code yourself

This wallet uses the same cryptographic primitives as the Modulr blockchain:

- **Key derivation**: BIP39 mnemonic → BIP32 HD path `m/44'/7337'/0'/0'`
- **Signing**: ed25519 (via tweetnacl)
- **Hashing**: BLAKE3 for transaction IDs
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation

## Privacy
